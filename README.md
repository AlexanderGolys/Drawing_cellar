# Drawing Cellar
Exersize made for university class Introduction to Computer Science on University of Warsaw during my Cognitive Science major.

The program is drawing racks in cellar. 

The window width and height can be easily chosen in GlobalSetup class.
The padding and thickness also can be chosen in GlobalSetup. 

Maximal and minimal numbers of racks and shelves are based on window size.

Feel free to play with it.
I tried to document it well.

Making everything in one file may be irritating, but that was sadly the requirement.
